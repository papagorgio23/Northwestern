Application Engineering for Real-Time Analytics
================

## Course Description

This course introduces analytics application engineering within an
integrated environment, and full-stack development process. Students
learn how to implement client-side, web-based applications using a
model-view-controller framework. Students work with server-side systems
for responding to website requests and database queries. Students also
learn how to prepare indices for efficient and relevant search across
large document collections. They learn how to implement analytics
applications for processing real-time data streams, create and query
data logs, finding information from databases and document collections,
making service and product recommendations, and visualize data using
web-based frameworks. This is a case-study and project-based course with
a strong programming component.

## Course Objectives

  - Define key terms and concepts in application engineering for
    real-time and near real-time analytics.  
  - Explain the Full-Stack development process for web-based software
    applications.  
  - Compare and contrast software application architectures: MVC,
    client-server, and N-Tier.  
  - Evaluate web-based technologies for software application
    development: markup languages, scripting languages, programming
    languages, and web-application frameworks.  
  - Analyze and discuss the basic building blocks of Angular framework
    for creating real-time and near real-time web-based applications.  
  - Develop near real-time software application using Angular
    framework.  
  - Create back-end SQL and NoSQL databases to store, retrieve, filter,
    and monitor data and logs for geospatial and near real-time software
    applications.  
  - Create real-time charts and animated heat-maps for real-time and
    near real-time web-based applications.
