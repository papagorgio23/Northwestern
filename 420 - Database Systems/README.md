Database Systems
================

## Course Description

In this course students explore the fundamental concepts of database
management and data preparation. With a focus on applications in
large-scale data analytics projects, the course introduces relational
database systems, the relational model, normalization process, and
structured query language (SQL). The course discusses topics related to
data integration and cleaning, database programming for extract,
transform, and load (ETL) operations. Students learn NoSQL technologies
for working with unstructured data and document-oriented information
retrieval systems. They learn how to index and score documents for
effective and relevant responses to user queries. Students acquire
hands-on programming experience for data preparation and data extraction
using various data sources and file formats.

## Course Objectives

  - Define key terms, concepts and issues in data preparation and
    database management systems.  
  - Discuss the nature of data: structured data vs. unstructured data,
    small data vs. big data, clean data vs. messy data.  
  - Review and interpret Entity Relationship Diagrams. Generate and
    explain the business rules of a given data model.  
  - Discuss the architectures and technologies for relational database
    systems, data warehousing, information retrieval and search
    engines.  
  - Discuss the fundamental concepts of data storage, retrieval,
    analysis, data processing for data analytics applications.  
  - Apply the normalization process to analyze, design, and create
    relational database applications.  
  - Explain the concepts of indexing and relevance in information
    retrieval/search engines.  
  - Discuss the process used to collect data from internet of things
    (IoT) and social media servers.  
  - Use a high-level programming language for data extraction,
    preparation and exploration.  
  - Compare and contrast SQL database and NoSQL database systems and
    demonstrate the ability to interact with SQL and NOSQL databases.  
  - Construct indexes for information retrieval.  
  - Store and retrieve geospatial data and plot data on interactive
    maps.
