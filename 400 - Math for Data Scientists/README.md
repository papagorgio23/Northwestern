Math for Data Scientists
================

## Course Description

Mathematics is the underlying basis of many aspects of data science.
This course will provide students with an overview of much of the
mathematics used throughout the MSDS program. The course will begin with
a brief overview of algebraic concepts and linear functions, including
least squares lines. Some aspects of linear algebra will also be
covered, such as operations with matrices, linear systems of equations,
and linear systems of inequalities. The course will cover a few topics
in discrete mathematics such as algorithms and graphs. Following this,
the course will move on to calculus, both differential and integral.
Finally, the course will end with probability, an overview of
probability distributions and the normal distribution as a natural segue
into applied statistics.

## Course Objectives

  - Apply linear programming methods to real world models.  
  - Analyze and interpret mathematical models.  
  - Create graphs and trees to model real world problems.  
  - Calculate and analyze derivatives and integrals of real world
    models.  
  - Evaluate and interpret probabilistic models.
