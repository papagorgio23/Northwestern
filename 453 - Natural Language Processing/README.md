Application Engineering for Real-Time Analytics
================

## Course Description

A comprehensive review of text analytics and natural language processing
with a focus on recent developments in computational linguistics and
machine learning. Students work with unstructured and semi-structured
text from online sources, document collections, and databases. Using
methods of artificial intelligence and machine learning, students learn
how to parse text into numeric vectors and to convert higher dimensional
vectors into lower dimensional vectors for subsequent analysis and
modeling. Applications include speech recognition, semantic processing,
text classification, relevant search, recommendation systems, sentiment
analysis, and topic modeling. This is a project-based course with
extensive programming assignments.

## Course Objectives

  - Identify role of natural language processing (NLP) and text
    analytics in the data sciences arena, as well as the kinds of data
    corpora suitable for organizational needs together with their
    preprocessing and metatagging requirements.  
  - Extract both entities and concepts; be able to identify,
    characterize, and apply methods for entity and concept
    co-resolution; identify and select strategies for complex concept
    extraction, apply appropriate text vectorization methods
    (specifically Google’s Word2Vec and Doc2Vec).  
  - Identify, select, and apply both clustering and classification
    algorithms, together with other forms of machine learning including
    both supervised and unsupervised, including generative machine
    learning methods such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) and latent
    Direchlet Allocation (LDA).  
  - Select, apply, and evaluate methods for sentiment analysis and link
    analysis.  
  - Develop (at a basic level) both ontologies and taxonomies that can
    provide interpretation during text analytics, and use these to
    assist in context-dependent NLP.
